Core Functionality
User Query Handling
AIPlanandExecute is designed to handle user queries specifically related to the EmpowerID system. For instance, if a user wants to create a new person in EmpowerID, the component interprets this request using OpenAI's LLM.

Plan and Execute Logic
AIPlanandExecute employs a "Plan and Execute" approach to process user requests. Upon receiving a query, it interacts with the EmpowerID system's API to understand the available functionalities and procedures.

Planning Phase
Based on the user's query and the capabilities of the EmpowerID system, AIPlanandExecute creates a plan comprising a series of steps. These steps typically involve calling specific API endpoints of the EmpowerID system that correspond to the actions required to fulfill the user's request.

LLM used: GPT-4

Execution Phase
AIPlanandExecute takes over to perform the planned steps. This involves making calls to the EmpowerID API, executing actions, and retrieving responses.

LLM used: GPT-3.5-TURBO-16k

Plan Review and Adaptation
After each step's execution, AIPlanandExecute evaluates the outcome and the remaining steps. This review process ensures that the plan stays relevant and effective in achieving the user's goal. If necessary, the plan is updated to accommodate changes or new information obtained during execution.
